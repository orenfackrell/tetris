# tetris

After having a couple of weeks of inconsistency with practicing my coding and my work on TOP (The Odin Project) I am back to try and make a new game that I can play. 

My hope with this project is to use principles of OOP as I have been struggling to wrap my head around this for the last two weeks and has been the cause for my sticking point in motivation and consistency. So after seeing a game of tetris embedded on somebody's porfolio page I have wanted to make that myself, so I will try to apply the lessons being used in the Odin tic tac toe but instead put that into a game of tetris as that is currently interesting me more.
